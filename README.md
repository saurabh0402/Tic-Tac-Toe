# Tic-Tac-Toe
## An implementation of MiniMax algorithm in JavaScript.
#### This is a very basic Tic-Tac-Toe game created in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The user could play the game against the computer that uses MiniMax algorithm to decide the next move. The backend (which does nothing more than just sending the page) has been written in Node.js.
#### Try beating the bot ;)
